With the development of industry 4.0, more collaborative robots are being implemented in manufacturing environments. Hence, research in human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-cobot interaction (HCI) is gaining traction. However, the design of how cobots interact with humans has typically focused on the general able-bodied population, and these interactions are sometimes ineffective for specific groups of users. This study's goal is to identify interactive differences between hearing and deaf and hard of hearing individuals when interacting with cobots. Understanding these differences may promote inclusiveness by detecting ineffective interactions, reasoning why an interaction failed, and adapting the framework's interaction strategy appropriately.
