Resistor combinations are being frequently used by scientists and researchers to get the desired value of resistance. In literature; this is achieved either by connecting the resistors in various combinations or by manual tuning of potentiometers; which is quite tedious. Moreover; resistance value is compromised with another close available value most of the time. In the present work; an attempt is done to design a digital resistance box that provides the desired value of resistance by simply entering the value through a digital keypad. In the presented approach; a microcontroller is used to control the servo motor; on which the potentiometer is mounted. The resistance of the potentiometer get varied by servo motor; which is controlled by a microcontroller. The microcontroller is programmed to control the servo motor using binary search computational algorithm. Experimental results represent the efficacy of the proposed approach to generate the desired value of resistance.
