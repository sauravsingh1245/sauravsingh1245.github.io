I am a dedicated Ph.D. student, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. Program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My research focuses on creating adaptive human-robot teams using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically human-aware reinforcement learning.

With a strong foundation in electrical and computer engineering, I have been actively involved in developing innovative solutions that enhance the synergy between humans and robots. My journey in robotics and AI has been shaped by a robust academic background and extensive research experience, including projects on multimodal data fusion, push recovery for humanoid robots, and explainability in AI systems.

Throughout my academic career, I have been fortunate to collaborate with esteemed faculty members and industry professionals, contributing to various research publications and conference presentations. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, driving forward the field of robotics and AI.
